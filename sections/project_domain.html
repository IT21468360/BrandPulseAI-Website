      <p class="justify-text" style="font-size: 15px;">As the banking industry rapidly digitalizes, managing brand reputation through customer feedback analytics has become a strategic imperative. Social media, app stores, and online forums generate large volumes of multilingual, unstructured feedback in Sinhala, English, and Sinhala-English code-mixed formats. This necessitates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques across multiple stages, including keyword extraction, aspect classification, sentiment analysis, and explainable AI (XAI).</p>
      <br>
      <ol class="justify-text" style="font-size: 15px;">
        <li><strong>Keyword Extraction:</strong> A.-Dalhani and M. Nair [1] proposed hybrid methods combining TF-IDF, RAKE, and fine-tuned transformers for keyword extraction in multilingual text. However, these methods perform poorly on domain-specific and low-resource languages like Sinhala. BERT-based models such as KeyBERT have demonstrated high precision in identifying domain-specific terms but require adaptation for code-mixed data.</li>
        <li><strong>Aspect Classification:</strong> Boopathiraj et al. [2] used supervised machine learning models trained on annotated banking reviews to extract aspect-entity pairs. More recent approaches employ BERTweet and XLM-RoBERTa for fine-grained aspect categorization, yet these systems are under-explored in the context of Sri Lankan dialects and code-mixed text.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Vigshini and Dias [3] explored sentiment classification in bilingual corpora using BiLSTM and attention layers. Sinhala sentiment models have been benchmarked by Weeraprameshwara et al. [4], where XLM-R and mBERT demonstrated promising results on Facebook data. However, none provide sentiment scores or support for fine-grained mixed sentiment.</li>
        <li><strong>Explainable AI:</strong> Atanasova et al. [5] introduced SHAP and LIME in multilingual NLP for model interpretability. While widely used for English, their application in Sinhala and code-mixed languages remains limited due to morphological complexity and inconsistent transliteration.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p class="justify-text" style="font-size: 15px;">Despite substantial advancements, no integrated system currently addresses the complete pipeline of multilingual brand sentiment extraction, scoring, and explanation for the financial domain in Sri Lanka.</p>

            How can we build a real-time, explainable, and multilingual brand reputation
            management system to accurately classify and interpret customer sentiments
            in Sinhala, English, and code-mixed banking reviews?

          <p class="justify-text" style="font-size: 14px;">
            Traditional sentiment analysis tools lack the granularity, multilingual adaptability,
            and domain-awareness needed for financial institutions operating in linguistically
            diverse markets like Sri Lanka. Most existing systems overlook critical contextual
            nuances, especially in code-mixed content, and do not provide transparency in
            sentiment predictions, limiting their effectiveness in decision-making and customer
            experience enhancement.

        The proposed Multilingual Brand Reputation Management System consists of four integrated components designed to automate the entire pipeline from content extraction to explainable sentiment analysis in Sinhala, English, and code-mixed reviews.
        <br><br>
        <b>Component 01</b> begins with user-provided URLs, where web content is scraped using automated tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The extracted text is cleaned, normalized, and passed through a fine-tuned KeyBERT model to identify high-impact banking-related keywords such as ‚Äúloan issues‚Äù or ‚ÄúOTP failed.‚Äù
        <br>
        <b>Component 02</b> uses these keywords to retrieve additional web content relevant to banking services. The system processes this data by performing language detection, transliteration for Singlish inputs, and segmentation into structured review units suitable for analysis.
        <br>
        <b>Component 03</b> classifies each review into one of five banking aspects‚ÄîCustomer Support, Digital Banking, Loans and Credit Services, Transactions and Payments, or Trust and Security. A fine-tuned multilingual sentiment model then predicts sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and assigns a softmax-based sentiment score for each review.
        <br>
        <b>Component 04</b> applies explainability techniques using SHAP for English and LIME for Sinhala/code-mixed content to highlight the words that contributed most to each prediction. Users are then presented with a visual, transparent dashboard displaying sentiment labels, scores, keywords, and model explanations for better decision-making.
